### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Frank

* ðŸ“ž Iâ€™m currently focusing on getting hacker status on [HacktheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/186761) and trying to focus on web based challenges/machines.
* ðŸ““ Studying at CSULB with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Cyber Security.
* ðŸ’» working on [rust_dos](https://github.com/raav3n/rust_dos) on the side (:
* In case you're curious, rust_dos should perform a DoS attack and will try to focus on a DNS attack where I use a DNS as a proxy for my attack to flood an IP... Also trying to learn some Rust on the way, should be fun!
